                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <P>The gemsbok is a large antelope in the genus oryx.it is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa,such as the Kalahari Desert.A gemsbok's straight,rapier-like horns can reach 120cm in length and are longer and narrower in the female.They use horns in territorial combat and as lethal weapons against predators.Gemsbok can kill lions.</P>
                    <p>A low metabolism allows these antelopes to survive for much of the year without drinking.They get the moisture they need from their  food,including desert melons that they dig up in times of drought.Gemsbok minimise water loss through perspiration by allowing their body temperature to rise to an astonishing 45 degrees and then dissipating the stored heat at night.</p>,
                    
                    <p>With most other Kalahari antelope,one dominant breeding male controls a harem of females and young males form separate herds.By contrast,gemsbok form mixed herds of males and females.After giving birth a female hides her calf for 3-6 weeks,remaining nearby and visiting a few times a day to nurse.it does not develop its striking black-and-white face markings until it is ready to join the herd with the mother.</p>

                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are mammals of the family elephantidae and the largest existing land animals.Three species are currentlt recognised: the African bush elephant,the African forest elephant,the Asian elephant.</p>
                    <p>The family Elephantidae also contains severel now-extinct groups,including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants.African elephants have larger ears and concave backs,whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex backs.</p>
                    <p>Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk,tusks,large ear flaps,massive legs and a tough but sensitive skin.Elephants tend to hear or smell things first and then train their sight,instead of using vision as their primary sensory input.they keep track of their family members and non-family members using just their sense of smell.</p>
                    
                    <p>The trunk weighs around 130kg and is capable of lifting about 250kg.it is also extremely dexterous,sensitive and mobile,which makes it appear independent from the rest of the body.Anatomically,elephant trunk is a combination of the nose and upper lip.The nostrils are at the tip.</p>
                    <p>Elephants can live in nearly any habitat that has edequate quantities of food and water.</p>
                    <p>In China,India and Africa the Elephant is a symbol of beauty,power,dignity,inteligence and peace.It is considered a symbol of good luck and good fortune.</p>

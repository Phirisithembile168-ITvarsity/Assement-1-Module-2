                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>The panda bear is a bear native to south central China.It is characterised by large,black patches around its eyes,over the ears and across its round body.The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda,a neighboring musteloid.Giant pandas are black and white bears.In the wild they are found in thick bamboo forests high up the mountains of central China.</p>
                    <p>These magnificent mammals are omnivores.But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.Pandas are big eaters-every day they fill up their tummies for up to 12 hours,shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!The giant panda's scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca.</p>
                    
                    <p>Giant pandas grow between 1.2m and 1.5m and weigh between 75kg and 135kg.Scientists arent sure how long pandas live in the wild but they live to be around 30 years old.Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm.They are born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.Its thought that these magnificent mammals are solitary animals,with males and females only coming together briefly to mate.Giant pandas occasionally meet outside of breeding season and comunicate with each other through scent marks and calls.Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs every two years.Cubs stay with their mothers for 18 months before venturing off on their own.</p>

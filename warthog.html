                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <P>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland,savannah and woodland in sub-saharan Africa.In the past it was commonly treated as a subspecies of p.aethiopicus but today the scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of nothern Kenya,Somalia and Eastern Ethopia.</P>
                    <p>Warthogs as one might guess from the name are members of the Swine family and are related to pigs,boars and hogs.As the name also suggests,warthogs have patches on their faces that look like warthogs but are just thick growths of skin.These patches act as padding for when males fight during mating season.</p>
                    
                    <p>Like their relatives,warthogs are plump,hooved animals with large nostrils at the end of the snout.They have little fur,except for a mane that goes down the spine to the middle of the back,according to the Animal Diversity web.Their tails also end with a tuft of hair.They have large teeth or tusks.</p>
                    <p>Common warthogs have two upper and four to six lower incisors,according to ADW,while desert warthogs lack incisors.The upper tusks grow up to 10 or 11 inches long,according to the San Diego zoo.</p>
                    <p>From hooves to shoulders warthogs are around 30 inches tall and 35 to 59 inches tall and 35 to 59 inches from shoulders to rump.They weigh a hefty 120 to 250lbs.Common warthogs are slightly larger than desert warthogs.</p>

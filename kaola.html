                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>The koala bear is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.It is the only extant representative of the family phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats,which members of the family Vombatidae.</p>
                    <p>The koala is about 60 to 80 cm long and weighs up to 14kg in the southern part of its range but only about half that in subtropical Queensland to the north.The body is stout and gray,with a pale yellow chest and mottling on the rump.The broad face has a wide,rounded nose,small yellow eyes and big fluffy ears.</p>
                    
                    <p>The koala feeds very selectively on the leaves of certain eucalyptus trees.Genarally solitery,individuals move within a home range of more than a dozen trees,one of which is favoured over the others.</p>
                    <p>Formerly killed in huge numbers for their fur,especially during the 1920s and 30ss koalas dwindled in number from several million to a few hundred thousand.In the southern part of their range,they became practically extinct,exept for a single population in Gippsland.</p>

                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffe are the tallest mammals on earth.Their legs alone are taller than many humans_about 6 feet.They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances,or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.</p>
                    <p>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground.As a result,it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.Giraffes only need to drink once every few days.Most of their water comes from the plants that they eat.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up;they even sleep and give birth standing up.The giraffe calf can stand up and walk after about and hour and within a week,it starts to sample vegetation.Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period!They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time.</p>
                    
                    <p>A giraffes spots are much like human fingerprints.No two individual giraffes have excatly the same pattern.</p>
                    <p>Both male and female giraffes have two distinct,hair-covered horns called ossicones.Male giraffes use their horns to sometimes fight with other males.</p>

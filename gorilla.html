                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <P>Gorillas are ground-dwelling,predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central sub-saharan Africa.The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas.They are the largest living primates.</P>
                    <p>Gorillas are typically divided into two groups.The mountain gorilla lives in the mountainous regions of central Africa,while the lowland gorilla lives in the flat,dense forests of central and western Africa.Though the two types are very similar,they have few differences.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are herbivores.They usually eat vegetation such as wild celery shoots,roots,fruit,tree bark and tree pulp but they have been known to eat small animals and insects.A male can eat up to 40lbs of vegetation per day.Gorillas live in groups.Groups of gorillas are called troops or bands.A band of gorillas can have as many as 50 members sometimes a band consists of as few as two members.</p>
                    
                    <p>Troops are led by a dominant male,called a silverblack which can often be identified by a gray strip of hair on his back.Female gorillas are pregnant for nine months and usually give birth to only one infant at a time.Newborn gorillas weigh about 4lbs.From the time they're about 4 months to 2 or 3 years old,young gorillas ride on their mothers backs as a form of transportation.</p>
